                        <p>The game server is available for familiarization reasons
                            <a href="http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest">
                                http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest</a></p>

                        <p>This is the open source game. To realize your game, correct errors in the current
                            version and make the other corrections, you should
                            <a href="https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy">fork the project</a> at first.
                            There is the description in the Readme.md file in the repository root.
                            It is specified in the description what to do next.</p>

                        <p> If any questions, please write in <a href="skype:alexander.baglay">skype:alexander.baglay</a>
                            or Email <a href="mailto:apofig@gmail.com">apofig@gmail.com</a></p>

                        <h2>What is the gist of the game?</h2>

                        <p>You should write your bot for the hero who will beat the other
                            bots by the score it gets. All bots play on the same field of play.
                            The hero can move by idle cells to all four directions.</p>

                        <p>The hero can plant a bomb. The bomb will explode in 5 ticks (seconds).
                            The blast wave can affect inhabitants of the field.
                            All affected by the blast wave disappear. You can decline by
                            both your and someone else's bomb.</p>

                        <p>On her/his way, the hero can meet a meatchopper – red air-ballon
                            that destroys all bombermen on its way.</p>

                        <p>Each destroyed object on the field (bomberman, meatchopper,
                            destroyed walls) is restored in an instant in the other place.
                            If the bomberman is damaged, the penalty points (-50*)
                            are allocated to him.</p>

                        <p>The bomberman whose bomb destroyed something on the map receives
                            bonus points as follows: +10* – for the destroyed walls,
                            +100* – for the meatchopper, +1000* – for the enemy bomberman.</p>

                        <p>*Please ask Sensei about scores on this game.</p>

                        <p>All points are summed up. The player with the largest number of points
                            is considered to be a winner (prior to the due date).</p>

                        <p>So, the player <a href="register?gameName=bomberman">
                            registers on the server</a> by indicating her/his Email.</p>
                        <p>Then you should connect <a href="resources/user/bomberman-servers.zip">from code</a>
                            to the server via Web Sockets. This is the Maven project and it will suit for
                            playing in JVM languages. Inside this archive you can find also another languages.
                            To know how to launch it, refer to the root of the README.txt.</p>

                        <p>For the other languages, you should write a native client
                            (and then to share it with us by using Email: apofig@gmail.com)</p>
                        <p>Address to connect the game on the http://codenjoy.com server:</p>

                        <pre>http://codenjoy.com:80/codenjoy-contest/board/player/{userCode}?code={code}</pre>

                        <p>Address to connect the game on the server deployed in the local area network (LAN):</p>

                        <pre>http://$server_ip:8080/codenjoy-contest/board/player/{userCode}?code={code}</pre>

                        <p>Here 'user' is your player id and 'code' is your security token, you can get it from browser address bar after registration/login.</p>

                        <p>After connection, the client will regularly (every second) receive
                            a line of characters with the encoded state of the field. The format:</p>

                        <pre>^board=(.*)$</pre>

                        <p>With the help of regexp you can obtain a board line.
                            Example of the line from the server:</p>

                        <p>The line length is equal to the field square. If to insert a wrapping
                            character (carriage return) every sqrt(length(string)) characters, you
                            obtain the readable image of the field. </p>

                        <p>The first character of the line corresponds to a cell located on
                            the left-top corner and has the [0, 32] coordinate. The following
                            example shows the position of the bomberman (the ☺ character) – [19,25].
                            left-bottom corner has the [0, 0] coordinate.</p>

                        <p>Interpretation of characters is on the figure below.</p>

                        <pre>public enum Element {

    /// This is your Bomberman

                        <p>The game is turn-based, every second the server sends to your client
                            (bot) the state of the updated field at the moment and expects a
                            response of the team to the hero. Within the next second, the player
                            should give a command to the hero. If the player lost his/her chance,
                            the hero remains in place.</p>

                        <p>The commands (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) move the hero to the given direction
                            in one cell; ACT – leave a bomb on hero’s position. You can combine
                            movement commands with the ACT command by separating them by a comma.
                            The order (LEFT, ACT) or (ACT, LEFT) matters: either we move to the
                            left and plant a bomb there or we plant a bomb and run away to the left.
                            If a player uses the ACT command only, the bomb will be planted under
                            the hero without her/his move on the field.</p>

                        <p>The first task is to write a client’s WebSocket which will connect to the
                            server. Then you should “force” the hero to listen to the commands. This
                            is the way the gamer will prepare herself/himself to the main game. The
                            main goal is to play meaningfully and win.</p>

                        <p>Up to now, several clients for playing are implemented, for the following
                            programming languages: Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Python, C#).
                            The clients in the other languages are in the process of creation
                            (thanks to the active gamers!).</p>

                        <p>The client code does not give a considerable handicap to gamers because
                            you should spend time to puzzle out the code. However, it is pleasant
                            to note that the logic of communication with the server plus some high
                            level API for working with the board are implemented already.</p>
