                    Every participant opens playserver page in browser http://server_ip:8080</p>

                        <p><center><img src="files/12.png"></center></p>

                        <p>On the page <a href="/help">Read help</a>
                            you may download the bot template and read the rules</p>

                        <p><center><img src="files/3.png"></center></p>

                        <p>There are clients for different platforms, all of them are in zip file. Download it and open in your favorite IDE<br>

                        <p>First of all you have to register your bot in playserver</p>

                        <p><center><img src="files/4.png"></center></p>

                        <p>After this server will start to recognize you</p>

                        <p>In any moment you may leave the game by choosing Unregister</p>

                        <p><center><img src="files/63.png"></center></p>

                        <p>To start you have to run your bot template. Look at README file in the root folder.
                        	For instance, for Java client you have to just run maven command<br>
                        	<b>mvn jetty:run</b>
                           </p>

                        <p><a name="commands"></a>Class that implements AI is named DirectionSolver. 
                        	What you may return from method DirectionSolver.get()? 
                        	Only 5 commands, all of them are described in enum Direction: UP,
                            DOWN, LEFT и RIGHT — movement directions, а ACT - set the bomb</p>

                        <p>Constructor of DirectionSolver has one argument - board — it's an object that represents playing board.
                        	On the board you may see few types of objects. Their description is in enum Elements.

                        <p><center><img src="files/44.png"></center></p>

                        <p>Ok, let's go back to main menu</p>

                        <p><center><img src="files/112.png"></center></p>

                        <p> Here you may look at game boards</p>

                        <p><center><img src="files/45.png"></center></p>

                        <p>Runtime game info<br>
                            - Player Name<br>
                            - Number of player points<br>
                            - Maximum points gathered for one bot live<br>
                            - Level that you're on (TODO: not changing yet)</p>

                        <p>You're getting points for blowing up different objects on board and getting penalty when your bot dies</p>

                        <p>Have a nice game!</p>
